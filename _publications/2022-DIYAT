title: "Creating 3D Printed Assistive Technology Through Design Shortcuts: Leveraging Digital Fabrication Services to Incorporate 3D Printing into the Physical Therapy Classroom: Leveraging Digital Fabrication Services to Incorporate 3D Printing into the Physical Therapy Classroom"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/DIYAT
excerpt: 'Digital fabrication methods have been shown to be an effective method for producing customized assistive technology (AT). However, the skills required to utilize these tools currently require a high level of technical skill. Previous research showed that integration of these skills within physical therapy training is appropriate but that the level of technical difficulty required can be an issue. We worked to address these issues by introducing a group of PT students to maker concepts and having them develop custom AT for real end users with the help of makers.'
