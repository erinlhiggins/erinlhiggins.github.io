As stated in my Self-Assessment and Reflection, I have been working in informal education for years. This has been a passion of mine that I didn't know how to integrate into my computer engineering work. Luckily, at UMBC, I have been able to do work that perfectly combines all of my interests. Following, I present how I envision my dissertation to combine my interests into one cohesive project. 

Main Topic
======
The focus of my dissertation will be on creating equitable and accessible makerspaces in community rec centers. The framing of work will be around design justice and aligning makerspace with the social justice movements in their surrounding communities.
 
 Previous Work in this Area

 My Proposed Research Questions and Methodology
======
Moving forward, I would like to further evaluate the model presented in our publication on the first iteration of the rec-to-tech project. Baltimore City is currently in the process of opening a new rec center in the Cherry Hill neighborhood that will have a makerspace. They are currently working on staffing and logistical set up of this space. I feel it is the perfect space to investigate three things:
<ol>
 <li>Is the thematic model proposed from our intital iteration valid in this new context and what updates need to be made?</li>
 <li>Are padlets a successful format for generating youth feedback and data?</li>
 <li>And more generally, what are the barriers and facilitators to the process of setting up a makerspace in a community rec center?</li>
</ol>
To answer these questions, I propose utilizing an ethnographic approach. The main focus of ethnographies is "its focus on human society and culture" (Merriam & Tisdell, 2015). And culture here is defined as "the beliefs, values, and attitudes that structure the behavior patterns of a specific group of people" (Merriam & Tisdell, 2015). This method is approriate because I would be deeply studying and generating a "thick description" of the individuals and characteristics of one specific rec creation center. The main methods used would be participant observation within the space, semi-structured interviews with the staff, educators, administrators, and youth, and document review of any curriculum that is created or modified for the space. Another interesting research output would be artifacts generated by the space. Any use of the makerspace by the community for creating objects for personal use or economic reasons would be very interesting to study. The needs and interests gathered from my study would be shared with those in charge of the space to see how it affects the type of programming they offer within the space and to hopefully allow my study to benefit the individuals within the space. Baltimore City has had a historically difficult relationship with local universities. Because of this, I would ensure that my focus is not just on collecting data, but generating information and resources that actually benefit the members of the community that I am working with. 
 
 Timeline
======
As I have already published two preliminary works on this topic, I am hoping to write and defend my proposal by the end of 2023. My currently proposed methodology is ethnography. Ethnography takes a long time and generates a huge amount of data. As I already have established relationships, that will not be an issue, but I am hoping to spend 6 months to 1 year working very closely with the Cherry Hill Rec Center as they establish their makerspace and programming. This means that I will not complete my data collection until winter or early spring of 2024. I am hopeful that I will then spend the bulk of 2024 analyzing my data and writing my disseration with a goal of defending in spring 2025.
