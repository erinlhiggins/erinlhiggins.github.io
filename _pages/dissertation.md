As stated in my Self-Assessment and Reflection, I have been working in informal education for years. This has been a passion of mine that I didn't know how to integrate into my computer engineering work. Luckily, at UMBC, I have been able to do work that perfectly combines all of my interests. Following, I present how I envision my dissertation to combine my interests into one cohesive project. 

Main Topic
======
Equitable and accessible makerspace education in rec centers. Framing = design justice aligning makerspaces with social justice movements
 
 Previous Work in this Area
======
Equity and participation in learning through making
The role of the educator in makerspaces
Formal assessments in informal environments
Digital fabrication for assistive technology
 
 My Proposed Research Questions and Methodology
======
Validating my model, evaluations, and generating a toolkit for community organizations who want to do this
Ethnography :)
 
 Timeline
======
As I have already published two preliminary works on this topic, I am hoping to write and defend my proposal by the end of 2023. My currently proposed methodology is ethnography. Ethnography takes a long time and generates a huge amount of data. As I already have established relationships, that will not be an issue, but I am hoping to spend 6 months to 1 year working very closely with the Cherry Hill Rec Center as they establish their makerspace and programming. This means that I will not complete my data collection until winter or early spring of 2024. I am hopeful that I will then spend the bulk of 2024 analyzing my data and writing my disseration with a goal of defending in spring 2025.
