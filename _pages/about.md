I am a Human Centered Computing PhD student and research assistant at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I am interested in creating equitable and accessible makerspaces and observing the impact of these spaces in the community. I am also interested in using makerspaces to develop low-cost assistive technologies. I am currently working under Dr. Foad Hamidi in the <a href="https://www.participatoryfutures.com/">DARE Lab</a>.
