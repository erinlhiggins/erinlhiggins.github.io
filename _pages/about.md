I am a Postdoc Researcher in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.library.cmu.edu/services/evidence-synthesis">Evidence Synthesis Group</a> within CMU Libraries. I research how we can support cross disciplinary literature reviews with the support of AI tools. I am also interested in using makerspaces to develop low-cost assistive technologies and to teach youth about technology. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:erinhiggins@cmu.edu">erinhiggins@cmu.edu</a>.
