Below is my reflection on my growth and progress in the PhD program at UMBC. I discuss how my background led me to do the work that I am doing, how I have grown within the program thus far, and my future personal and professional goals. 

The Past
======
There were a few key components of my past that have had a major impact on my current work and future plans. Starting my freshman year of college, I took on a position as a rowing coach at a local high school to take care of my expenses. Luckily for me, I loved working with kids and being an educator. Through that role, I was offered another position as an after school teacher for a non-profit organization in Pittsburgh. Both of these experiences taught me about education and about the inequity present in the city that I called home. 

Separately, I had always wanted to travel. I was offered an opportunity to participate in a research experience in Singapore as a part of the computer engineering program at my school. I enjoyed the experience so much that I sought more research opportunities when I returned home. I quickly discovered, however, that hardware research wasn't for me and began to look for opportunities to do research that was more human centered. This opportunity came from the Human Engineering Research Lab at Pitt where I did my co-op. For three months at a time, I would work full time as a research assistant while continuing my teaching work at night. 

After graduating with a large amount of debt, I decided that I should pay down my loans for some time with a full time engineering job. I worked in the telecommunications industry for just over a year before deciding that work as a full time software engineer was not as fullfilling to me as work as a research assistant. 

I returned to the Human Engineering Research Lab to do my master's degree in rehabilitation science. There, I was able to work on more human focused research projects as well as to spend time working on brain computer interfaces at the Rehabilitation Neural Engineering Lab. Even thought I really enjoyed these expereinces, I often found that my knowledge of computer science locked me into a role as the "technical expert" on teams. I was often designing websites or databases instead of getting to do work with real users. Throughout the time, I continued teaching with non-profit organizations throughout Pittburgh. 

As I was considering what to pursue for my PhD, I was searching all over the country for a position that would allow me to combine my knowledge and expertise in computer science, rehabilitation science, and informal education. Luckily for me, that position existed at UMBC. 
 
 The Present
======
My current position in the DARE Lab at UMBC have given me the opportunity to conduct the exact research that I have always wanted to do. I have two main projects and focuses: the rec-2-tech project and accessible making. The rec-2-tech project has many moving parts. We are working with two cities, Baltimore and my hometown of Pittsburgh, to co-desgin curriculum to introduce maker concepts to youth in rec centers. This work involves me going into rec centers and working with kids regularly, something I have always loved and feel very confident in doing thanks to my previous experiences. I also am able to learn the benefits and challenges of working in these spaces and working together with experts to develop curriculum that is localized and easy to implement in these spaces. The accessible maker work has been primarily on campus. From disability advocacy organizations, we have recruited individuals to develop their own custom AT using 3D printers. Both projects are on-going and have allowed me to utilize all of my previous experience in the perfect way. 

Aside from research, my education at UMBC has helped me to grow exponentially. The quality of my writing has increase exponentially because of the feedback from by advisor and going through the process of submitting to journals and conferences. Dr. Hamidi's guidance has helped me to quickly learn how to navigate a new field to get my work out there. I have also learned a great deal about methods and how to apply them from my qualitative and quantitative methods courses. Even though I had done research for several years before joining UMBC, I had never really been taught the reasons behind methodology or how to conduct high quality research and communicate about it effectively. Most importantly to me, however, has been learning that doing community work demands creating and sustaining genuine connections with members of the community around you. In previous work, it could feel like the end users were people that we "needed" to prove our effectiveness. Since doing work with the community and implementing participatory methods, I have learned to see individuals as experts of their own domains who can offer a great amount of knowledge and expertise in deisgn.

Finally, at UMBC I have been given many opportunities to participate in the HCI community through volunteering and peer-review as well as to mentor students in the program at UMBC. I have been given the opportunity to be a student volunteer at ASSETS 2021 as well as to peer-review articles for CHI 2022 and 2023. This work has helped me to understand the process of sharing academic work and has given be a greater understanding of what goes into being accepted at and attending a conference. I have also had the great opportunity to present work at ASSETS 2022 which was a great venue for a first conference presentation. Meeting my peers and professors in the field has helped me to better understand the landscape of the field of HCI in general. My favorite part of my PhD thus far, however, has been mentoring younger students. I have had the opportunity to mentor two master's students and three undergraduates. They have assisted me in data collection and analysis and several of them also came up with their own projects. Sharing my experience and exposing early career researchers to some of this work for the first time has been a wonderful experience for me. The great mentorship I have received from multiple professors within the HCC department has given me great inspiration for how to work with and mentor students through this process.
 
 The Future
======
It is my hope to remain in academia after graduation. My dream would be to return to my hometown and get a full time professor position at a university in Pittsburgh. As there are several great universities in that city, I hope that this will be a reasonable goal. There are many other wonderful universities that I would be happy to work at if I am given the chance! In the mean time, however, I am hoping to do an internship in industry to see what the experience would be as a PhD before I completely decide to remain in academia. 

It has always been my hope to someday get a PhD. All of my interests have led me directly to where I am today and no other program had such a perfect fit for me as UMBC. With any luck, I will be continue to develop community relationships and utilizing participatory design methodologies to create inclusive makerspaces and increase diversity in tech.
